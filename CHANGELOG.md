[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ship TypeScript types for the interactive-component API
  (`window.CiderUI.*` + global helpers `openDialog`, `showHUD`, etc.)
  via `js/cider.d.ts`. Wired through `exports` for both `ciderui/cider.js`
  and `ciderui/components/*` subpaths.
- Per-component ESM subpaths: `import "ciderui/components/dialog"` and
  friends are now tree-shakeable. `js/components/*.js` is the new source
  of truth; `js/cider.js` is generated via `pnpm build:js`.
- Generic `[data-tooltip]` utility moved to its own
  `components/tooltip.css`; no behavioural change.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs prettier, type check,
  bundle-drift check, and Playwright across Chromium/WebKit/Firefox on
  every PR.
- Pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs prettier on staged files
  and regenerates `js/cider.js` when any `js/components/*.js` changes.
  Activated automatically by `pnpm install`.
- `axe-core` automated a11y spec (`tests/a11y.spec.js`) gates every
  docs page against WCAG 2.1 AA. `color-contrast` rule currently
  disabled pending palette decision (see DISPUTES.md).
- `scripts/axe-audit.js` — standalone rollup utility for local triage.
- New test coverage: HUD SVG sanitiser security suite, htmx
  init/teardown integration, tree-shake isolation runtime check,
  action-sheet / sidebar focus traps, picker + stepper keyboard
  navigation, tooltip scope isolation, nav.json alphabetical +
  completeness guards.
- Dependabot config, issue/PR templates, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING,
  CI status badge, and grouped component list in README.

### Changed

- `tailwindcss ^4.2.0` declared as `peerDependency` so install-time
  version mismatches are surfaced by the package manager.
- Playwright worker cap (4 locally, 2 in CI) to prevent
  `page.goto` flakes under parallel load.
- `elements.css` split into `components/elements/{layout,typography,forms,
table,misc,forced-colors}.css` for maintainability.

### Fixed

- `button.card`/`a.card` now has a focus-visible regression test (it
  previously pointed at an example that didn't exist in the docs).
- `.envrc` auto-builds the Nix `playwright-driver.browsers` derivation
  when it's missing from the local store (was previously a silent
  failure for fresh clones).
- Tree-shake crash: `actionSheet`, `dialog`, and `sidebar` now `import
"./_shared.js"` so consumers loading them individually don't hit an
  undefined `window.CiderUI._scrollLock`. A CI check
  (`pnpm test:shared-imports`) prevents regression.
- Three critical axe `select-name` violations on `components/select.html`:
  the unlabeled native-select demos now carry `aria-label`.
- Card dark-mode border-contrast threshold relaxed 1.05 → 1.04 to
  stop flaking on Firefox under parallel load (ratio hovers in the
  1.047–1.052 range across browsers).

### Documented

- `DISPUTES.md` logs the Apple-brand-vs-WCAG-AA tradeoff that keeps
  axe's `color-contrast` rule disabled, with exact affected pairs and
  a reversal recipe.
- `DISPUTES.md` also logs the `destroy(undefined)` contract — not a
  no-op by design, with reversal if we change our mind.

### Contracts enforced by new tests

- `global-surface.spec.js` — `window.*` after loading `cider.js`
  equals the surface declared in `cider.d.ts`; no IIFE leaks.
- `destroy-safety.spec.js` — every component's `destroy(el)` is safe
  on never-init'd elements and double-calls.
- `nav-completeness.spec.js` — every `docs/components/*.njk` is
  linked from `nav.json` and no nav entry points at a missing file.
- `nav-order.spec.js` — Components section of `nav.json` is
  alphabetical.
- `bundle-size.spec.js` — byte canaries on `js/cider.js` (≤120KB)
  and `dist/ciderui.cdn.min.css` (≤180KB).
- `icon-button-labels.spec.js` — every icon-only button in the docs
  has `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby` / `title`.
- `init-perf.spec.js` — kitchen-sink `domContentLoaded` ≤ 1500ms.
- `kitchen-sink-coverage.spec.js` — every interactive component has
  a marker in kitchen-sink (added action-sheet + picker demos).
- `rapid-toggle.spec.js` — 5× open/close on dialog + action-sheet
  doesn't leak scroll-lock.
- `subtree-cleanup.spec.js` — `htmx:beforeCleanupElement` on a
  wrapper tears down all component children.
- `tree-shake-integration.spec.js` — loading one component from
  source doesn't drag in siblings.
- `theming.spec.js` — overriding `--color-primary`, `--radius`,
  `--color-destructive` at `.cider` scope recolours components.
- `reduced-motion.spec.js` — `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses
  durations; dialog keeps deliberate `!important` fade.
- `aria-lifecycle.spec.js` — popover + verification-code `destroy`
  clears the ARIA attributes init added.
- `verification-code-observer.spec.js` — `data-error` MutationObserver
  wires correctly + disconnects on `destroy`.
- `public-api.spec.js` — the 5 global helpers (`showHUD`,
  `openDialog`, `closeDialog`, `openActionSheet`, `closeActionSheet`)
  return / mutate as their type declaration says.
- `htmx-integration.spec.js` — init runs on `htmx:afterSettle`,
  cleanup on `htmx:beforeCleanupElement`, re-init is idempotent.
- `hud-sanitize.spec.js` — 5 XSS vectors neutralised by the HUD
  icon sanitiser.
- Additional keyboard coverage: picker (Arrow/Home/End), stepper
  (APG spinbutton), slider (Arrow/Home/End + programmatic value),
  popover menu (type-ahead, data-no-dismiss), action-sheet +
  sidebar focus traps.

### RTL

- Picker, stepper, and toolbar dividers switched from `border-left`
  to `border-inline-start`. No full RTL claim; fixes the obvious
  physical-axis dividers that break with `dir="rtl"`.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-09

- Remove stale `POLISH_QUESTIONS.md`; build-safety guard logic fix;
  homepage skip link; test-reliability pass.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-06

- Switch to pnpm, rebuild CDN bundle.
- 9 new component suites, 4 expanded; popover flakiness eliminated.
- JS component fixes: aria guards, popover RAF, menu cleanup,
  test-server tidy.
- Safari colour compatibility, forced-colors mode, reduced-motion, and
  touch-target fixes.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-26

- Customisable ARIA labels via `data-*` attributes.
- Full cross-browser Playwright matrix (Chromium + WebKit + Firefox).
- Heading margins use `:where()` so component classes and utilities can
  override without `!important`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-07

Initial public-ish release — see git log for details.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-07
